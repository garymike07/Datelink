# Notification Sound Placeholder
# 
# To add a notification sound:
# 1. Find or create a short notification sound (MP3 format, < 1 second)
# 2. Save it as public/notification.mp3
# 3. Common sources: https://notificationsounds.com/ or create your own
# 
# For now, the app will gracefully handle the missing sound file
# by catching the error when attempting to play it.
